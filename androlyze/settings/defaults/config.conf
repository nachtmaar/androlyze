# This is the config for the celery worker as well as for the AndroLyze CLI
# Dependent on the analysis mode you use, you have to configure different parts of the configs
# Absolutely necessary: Part1 and Part2
# Distributed mode: Part3 and optionally Part4 for SSH deployment support with fabric

###############################################################################
### Part1: AndroLyze Analysis Initiator
###############################################################################

[File System]

# If enabled results will be written to the file system too
# If you switch from disabled to enabled, sync with "androsync" first!
enabled = True

# Define the root directory where the results will be stored in the file system
# If it doesn't exist, it will be created
result_dir = storage/

[Database]

# Specify the path to the import database
import_database = dbs/import.db

[Parallelization]

# parallelization mode
# choose between: "non-parallel", "parallel", "distributed"
# "parallel" performs an analysis using processes on the local machine
# "distributed" using message passing in a distributed system (RabbitMQ + Celery)
mode = "parallel"

# number of worker threads/processes for mode "parallel"
#concurrency = None

###############################################################################
### Part2: Shared Config for Analysis Initiator and Celery Worker
###############################################################################

[Androguard]

# The path to androguard
androguard_path = androguard/

[ApkDistributedStorage]

# from where to get the APKs
# and to where the APKs shall be imported (if "./androimport" used with "-cdb" switch)
# choose between "S3Storage" and "ResultDatabase" (mongoDB)
storage_engine = ResultDatabase

[ResultDatabase]
# MongoDB Storage for APKs and result database (NoSQL)

# ip of mongodb server
mongodb_ip = 127.0.0.1

# port of mongodb server

# the name of the database that will be used for storage
# will be created if not existing already

# if no authentication wanted leave it commented out
# username
mongodb_username = androlyze

# passwdord
mongodb_passwd = yourpassword

# use ssl for mongodb ?
use_ssl = True

# path for ca certificate file
ca_cert = conf/distributed/ssl/androlyze_ca.pem

[S3Storage]
# Amazon S3 Storage for APKs

# aws id
aws_access_key_id = 
# aws key
aws_secret_access_key = 
# aws s3 host url
aws_s3_host = s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
# bucket name where the APKs are stored
# define your bucket name (you have to create if before)
# the default value raises a RuntimeError!

###############################################################################
### Part3: Celery Worker Config
###############################################################################

[Broker]

# change user, password, host, port and virtual host!
# the broker url (with credentials included)
# port 5672 is non-ssl, 5671 is ssl
broker_url = amqp://androlyze:androlyze@127.0.0.1:5671/androlyze_vhost
# the backend for result storage
backend_url = amqp://androlyze:androlyze@127.0.0.1:5671/androlyze_vhost

# ssl config
use_ssl = True

# you can also supply ~/ssl/ paths etc.
ca_cert = conf/distributed/ssl/androlyze_ca.pem

# authenticate client against broker (use client certificates) ?
auth_client = True
# client private key
client_keyfile = conf/distributed/ssl/androlyze_client.key
# client certificate
client_certfile = conf/distributed/ssl/androlyze_client.crt

[Analysis]

# compare and validate sent script hashes with local script hashes
script_hash_validation = True

# fault-tolerance

# an entry uncommented means retry infinite

# try to open the result database number of times until giving up
# failure means task rescheduling
result_db_open_retry_cnt = 0

# try to store the result number of times until giving up
# failure means task rescheduling
analysis_store_results_retry_cnt = 0

# number of times to retry the opening of the scripts
# maybe another node has the scripts deployed
scripts_load_retry_cnt = 0

# uncomment for no time limits at all!
# soft time limit for analyze task (in minutes)
soft_time_limit = 30
# hard time limit for analyze task (in minutes)
hard_time_limit = 31

# revoke tasks if user aborts analysis?
# otherwise workers will continue executing the analysis job
task_revocation = True

### Part4: Fabric Deployment Stuff
### Only necessary if you want to use fabric for SSH deployment!
###############################################################################

[Deployment]
# options only needed if u want to use fab for the project and script deployment on the workers

# celery worker name
worker_name = celery

# specify the workers (ip addresses or host names, optional with username)
# has to be comma separated

# where AndroLyze is located, will get user expanded, so ~ can be used for paths
code_dir = ~/androlyze/

# where the userscripts are located
userscripts_path = scripts_user/

# git urls for repo updating
repo_path_git_url = https://github.com/nachtmaar/androlyze.git

repo_branch = master
# specifiy private ssh-key and fingerprint of host for private repository encoded as base64
